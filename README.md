**Learning by Doing: From Tableau Practice to Research Insights**
I'm excited to share a recent project that has been both a fantastic learning experience and a valuable asset in my ongoing research journey. As part of my quest to broaden my data visualization skills, I embarked on a Tableau practice project inspired by an insightful YouTube tutorial ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTArwS4ljC4&t=719s]). The goal was to explore Tableau's capabilities and create a comprehensive Netflix dashboard.
In this practice project, I dived deep into the world of data visualization, learning how to create various charts and assemble them into a cohesive dashboard. In this project, I explored a treasure trove of Netflix data and crafted some eye-catching visualizations:
🎬 Total Movies and TV Shows by Year: I tracked how the content library evolved over time, revealing fascinating trends.
🌎 Total Movies and TV Shows by Country: A map showing where and how many Netflix content originates w.r.t country.
📊 Top 10 Genres: Discover the most popular genres based on the dataset.
📊 Movies and TV Shows Percentage Distribution: Visualizing the total movies and tv shows distribution on Netflix.
⭐ Content Rating Classifications Insights: Explore different content ratings and its count on netflix.
📖 Movie/TV Show Details: Get up close and personal with the title, duration, date added, release year, and rating.
After developing these insightful charts, I brought them all together into one dynamic dashboard. I'm excited to showcase my newfound Tableau skills and the power of data visualization. 
While this project was initially a learning exercise, it didn't stop there. I realized that the skills and techniques I honed during this practice project could be directly applied to my ongoing research. It's been an amazing learning journey, and I saw an opportunity to leverage Tableau's power to uncover valuable insights in my research data.
I'm excited to continue exploring Tableau and its potential applications in my field. Learning is a continuous journey, and I'm eager to see where it takes me next.
